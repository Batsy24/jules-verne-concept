# Conceptual Web Design: Jules Verne reading experience
A concept for a virtual reading experience for Jules Verne's twenty thousand leagues under the sea. Created as part of an assignment for sophomore year Interaction Studio at Parsons BFA communication design. 

### Brief
The class was assigned to develop a website surrounding a text of our choosing over 5 weeks. I chose the second chapter to Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea. I chose to go with an Art NOveau aesthetic and developed this rough proof of concept over five weeks. All illustrations, code and design are mine. The text is public domain.
